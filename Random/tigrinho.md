-- Wild Symbols & their roles:
Scatters  

Scatter symbols are unique because they don’t have to appear in a straight line to win. Here’s what happens when they do appear:  

    Trigger a win or special feature. Scatters slot symbols can appear anywhere on the reels and do not need to be on the payline.   
    Landing a certain number of scatter symbols – for instance, three or more – will trigger free spins. These free spins will let you spin the reel a certain number of times without betting your own money and give you more chances of winning.  
    Trigger bonus games. These bonus games are like mini-games with different rules. These can also sometimes be accessed through a bonus buy.  
    Scatter wins can lead to your total bet being multiplied, leading to larger payouts.
